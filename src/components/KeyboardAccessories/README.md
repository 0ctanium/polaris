# Keyboard accessories

On iOS and Android you have software keyboards appearing on the screen when typing. Keyboard accessories allows additional content and actions based on what merchants are doing. Example when updating a description and you want controls for bolding, italicizing, and underlining.

## Best practices

Keyboard accessories should:

- Have a maximum height of:
  - 44pt on iOS
  - 48dp on Android
- Consider a horizontally swipeable interaction if you have many actions or a lot of content
  - Provide an easy hint or introduction to make the merchant aware of the swipe interaction
- Make actions grouped and expandable if possible. By doing this, you’ll reduce visual noise and complexity for the merchant
