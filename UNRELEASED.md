### Enhancements

### Bug fixes

- Removed reference to `window` in `DropZone` ([#2532](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/pull/2532))
- Fixed a regression in `TrapFocus` that prevented focus outside of an `iframe` ([#2530](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/pull/2530))

### Documentation

- Changed a link to the Polaris icons documentation so it would point to npm (a public resource) rather than the `Shopify/polaris-icons` repository (which is now private) ([#2452](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/pull/2452))
