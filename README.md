A UI component library written in our modern FED tech stack (Typescript, React)

This is the internal version of the [Polaris repo](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris). All changes and issues should be made here, and the changes will be applied to the public version when we release a new version.

## Development

Weâ€™ve created a simple, hot-reloading playground for development on these components. You can edit the `playground/Playground.tsx` file to import the components you are working on, and run `yarn run playground` in order to start the development server. Please do not commit your work on the playground so that it is pristine for other developers to work on.
